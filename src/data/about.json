    "about": [
        "Over 14 years of experience have taught me how to be an adaptable professional capable of taking on new groundbreaking ideas or adapt to an already developed solution and improve upon it. I am ready to pursue new challenging projects and keep learning, while working hard demonstrating the value I can bring to the company. I enjoy working in a diverse team and share opinions on how to best achieve our objectives. I take ownership and responsibility of my work, but most of all, I strive to feel pride of what I do and specially on how I do it, believing success as a part a team is better than individual achievements.",
        "I like to read and think about all the projects and ideas I could be doing instead of watching TV (opened tabs in my browser are wild). I like to learn new non-code-related skills (next in the list are guitalele and hopefully more japanese). Iâ€™m a quiet person by nature, quirky, and enjoy good banter at work and with friends. Cats will usually make an appearance and voice their opinion in video calls."
